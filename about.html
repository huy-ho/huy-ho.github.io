                <p>
                Hello! I graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in December 2022 with an undergraduate
                degree in Data Science. I was born in Vietnam and grew up in beautiful San Diego in Southern California.
                </p>

                <p>I’m fascinated by how systems are built, scaled, and kept secure. I’m especially drawn to infrastructure, cloud computing, security, AI, and consumer products.</p>
                <p>
                Some of my aspirations include leading a major consumer product, working on counter-intelligence and national defense, 
                creating the next Triple-A video game, and building large-scale cloud and infrastructure systems.
                </p>

                <p>
                Outside of work, I play soccer, listen to all kinds of music, watch crime and spy dramas (like 
                <em>The Americans</em>, <em>Peaky Blinders</em>, <em>Breaking Bad</em>, and <em>Ozark</em>), 
                and enjoy cooking as an avid home chef.
                </p>

                <h2>Beyond Tech</h2>
                <p>
                    While much of my curiosity revolves around technology, I’m also drawn to the world beyond it. I often watch YouTube videos on these topics while having a meal.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Geography: Understanding how different places, cultures, and environments influence societies fascinates me. Quiz me on capital cities or country flags!

                    </li>                
                    <li>History: I’m interested in modern world history from World War I to today including wars, politics, and economics. I would often watch war movies and documentaries.</li>
                    <li>
                        Urban Planning & Infrastructure: For some odd reason, I am interested in how cities, airports, shipping routes, and transport systems are built and connected.

                    </li>
                    <li>Finance & Real Estate: I enjoy investing and following the stock market. I like driving through neighborhoods and looking at homes. Long term, I'm interested in mixed-use real estate developments. </li>
                    <li>National Defense & Strategy: I’m interested in counter-intelligence, security, and global strategy.</li>
                    <li>Gaming: I love games! Games I enjoy are Dota 2, Counter-Strike, TFT. I also enjoy strategy and simulation games like Civilization, XCOM, and Cities Skyline.</li>
                    <li>Sports: I dreamed of going pro in soccer until a humbling U11 academy match reminded me there are levels to this. I play soccer, tennis, and I am planning to learn golf. </li>
