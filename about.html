            <div class="about-text"> 
                <p> Hello. I am currently a senior at UC Berkeley majoring
                    in Data Science and Statistics expected to graduate in Spring 2022.
                    I was born in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam but grew up
                    here in Sunny California.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am interested in intersection between technology, artificial intelligence,
                    and social good as I believe it is our responsibility to use techs to help
                    people that are less fortunate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of academics, I like to play soccer, play video games (CSGO, Overwatch)
                    and watch crime/sci-fi tv shows (The Man in the High Castle, The Americans)
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
