            <p>Hello! I graduated from UC Berkeley in December 2022 with an undergraduate degree in Data Science. I was born in Vietnam but grew up in Southern California.</p>

            <p>I am interested in the intersection between technology, data science, statistics, and economics. Some topics that fascinate me are security, cloud computing, national defense, the stock market, and real estate. I believe technology is essential for future advancement, and I want to help businesses innovate by creating software that finds solutions.</p>

            <p>I am also a believer in the social good sector—it is our responsibility to use technology to help others and solve civic injustices and social issues.</p>

            <p>Some of my aspirations include leading a product team, working in counter-intelligence, or even heading a team to design the next Triple-A video game. Outside of work, I like to play soccer, listen to music, watch crime/sci-fi shows (like <em>The Americans</em> and <em>Peaky Blinders</em>), and I am an avid chef.</p>
