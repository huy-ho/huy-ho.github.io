            <div class="about-text"> 
                <p> Hello! I am currently a senior at UC Berkeley majoring
                    in Data Science and Statistics expected to graduate in December 2022.
                    I was born in Vietnam but grew up in Southern California. 
                </p>

                <p class="bold">
                    I am interested in intersection between technology, artificial intelligence, and statistics. I believe these tools 
                    are essential for advancement in the future. It is limitless and I am fascinated by all the different ways we can apply these concepts.
                    I am also a believer in the social good sector as it is our responsibility to use tech to solve civics, injustices, and social issues.
                </p>

                <p class="bold">
                    Some of my aspirations include: working for the CIA on counter-intelligence, on a cyber-security team for the Department of Defense, becoming a head coach for a soccer team in Europe, or 
                    leading a team to design the next Triple-A video game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of academics, I like to play soccer, video games, watch
                    crime/sci-fi tv shows (The Man in the High Castle, The Americans, Peaky Blinders, Narcos), and an avid chef.
