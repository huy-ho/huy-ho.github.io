                <p>
                I graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in December 2022 with an undergraduate
                degree in Data Science.
                </p>

                <p>I'm currently a Software Engineer at Cisco, where I work on backend services, data platforms, infrastructure, and applied AI.</p>

                <p>I'm fascinated by how systems are built, scaled, and kept secure. My interests span infrastructure and cloud computing, distributed systems, security, data engineering, AI, and consumer products. I'm particularly drawn to problems where performance, reliability, and scale intersect.</p>
                
                <p>
                Some of my aspirations include leading breakthrough AI-powered consumer products, working on counter-intelligence and national defense, creating the next Triple-A video game, and building large-scale cloud and infrastructure systems.

                <h2>Beyond Tech</h2>
                <p>
                    Beyond technology, I'm drawn to understanding how the world works. These topics shape how I think about both technology and the real world, seeing them as systems that connect, scale, and evolve. I often watch YouTube videos on these subjects (some favorites linked below).

                    <li>
                        Geography: Understanding how different places, cultures, and environments influence societies fascinates me. Quiz me on capital cities or country flags!

                    </li>                
                    <li>History: I’m interested in modern world history from World War I to today including wars, politics, and economics. I would often watch war movies and documentaries.</li>
                    <li>
                        Urban Planning & Infrastructure: For some odd reason, I am interested in how cities, airports, shipping routes, and transport systems are built and connected.

                    </li>
                    <li>Finance & Real Estate: I enjoy investing and following the stock market. I like driving through neighborhoods and looking at homes. Long term, I'm interested in mixed-use real estate developments. </li>
                    <li>National Defense & Strategy: I’m interested in counter-intelligence, security, and global strategy.</li>
                    <li>Gaming: I enjoy games like Dota 2, Counter-Strike, and TFT. I also like strategy and simulation games like Civilization, XCOM, and Cities Skyline.</li>
                    <li>Sports: I dreamed of going pro in soccer until a humbling U11 academy match reminded me there are levels to this. I play soccer, tennis, and I am planning to learn golf. </li>
