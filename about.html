                <p> Hello! I recently graduated from UC Berkeley with a degree in Data Science in December 2022! I was born in Vietnam but grew up in Southern California.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am interested in intersection between technology, data science, statistics, and economics. Some topics that interested me are: security, national defense, customer-facing products, the stock market, and real estate. I believe technology is continuously growing
                    and they are essential for advancement in the future. It is limitless and I am fascinated by all the different ways we can apply these concepts. I like to create software and I want to help businesses find solutions and innovate. I
                    am also a believer in the social good sector as it is our responsibility to use tech to help others and solve civics, injustices, and social issues.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Some of my aspirations include: create and manage a product at a big company, working for the CIA on counter-intelligence, on a security team for a leading company, becoming a head coach for a soccer team in Europe, or leading a team to design the next Triple-A video game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of academics, I like to play soccer, video games, watch crime/sci-fi tv shows (The Man in the High Castle, The Americans, Peaky Blinders, Narcos), and an avid chef.
