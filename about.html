            <p>
            Hello! I graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in December 2022 with an undergraduate
            degree in Data Science. I was born in Vietnam and grew up in beautiful San Diego in Southern California.
            </p>

            <p>
            I’m fascinated by how systems are built, scaled, and kept secure, and I’m especially drawn to infrastructure, cloud computing, security, AI, and consumer products.
            </p>

            <p>
            Some of my aspirations include leading a major consumer product, working on counter-intelligence and national defense, 
            creating the next Triple-A video game, and building large-scale cloud and infrastructure systems.

            </p>

            
            <p>
            Outside of work, I play soccer, listen to all kinds of music, watch crime and spy dramas (like 
            <em>The Americans</em>, <em>Peaky Blinders</em>, <em>Breaking Bad</em>, and <em>Ozark</em>), 
            and enjoy cooking as an avid home chef.
            </p>
