                <p> Hello. I am currently a senior at UC Berkeley majoring
                    in Data Science and Statistics expected to graduate in Spring 2022.
                    I was born in Vietnam but grew up
                    here in Southern California.
                </p>
                <p class="bold">
                    I am interested in intersection between technology, artificial intelligence,
                    and social good as I believe it is our responsibility to use techs to solve civics, injustices, and social issues.
                    Technologies are capable of doing this, it is in our hands.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of academics, I like to play soccer, video games (CSGO, Overwatch)
                    and watch crime/sci-fi tv shows (The Man in the High Castle, The Americans, Peaky Blinders)
                </p>
