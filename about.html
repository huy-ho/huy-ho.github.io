                <p>
                Hello! I graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in December 2022 with an undergraduate
                degree in Data Science. I was born in Vietnam and grew up in beautiful San Diego in Southern California.
                </p>

                <p>
                I’m fascinated by how systems are built, scaled, and kept secure, and I’m especially drawn to infrastructure, cloud computing, security, AI, and consumer products.
                </p>

                <p>
                Some of my aspirations include leading a major consumer product, working on counter-intelligence and national defense, 
                creating the next Triple-A video game, and building large-scale cloud and infrastructure systems.

                </p>

                <p>
                Outside of work, I play soccer, listen to all kinds of music, watch crime and spy dramas (like 
                <em>The Americans</em>, <em>Peaky Blinders</em>, <em>Breaking Bad</em>, and <em>Ozark</em>), 
                and enjoy cooking as an avid home chef.

                <h2>Beyond Tech</h2>
                <p>
                    While much of my curiosity revolves around technology, I’m also drawn to the world beyond it. I often watch YouTube videos on these topics while having a meal.

                    Geography: Understanding how different places, cultures, and environments influence societies fascinates me.

                    <li>History: I’m fascinated by modern world history from World War I to today including wars, politics, economies, societies, and how global events. I would often watch war documentaries.</li>
                    <li>Urban Planning & Infrastructure: For some odd reason, I am interested in how cities, airports, shipping routes, and transport systems are built and connected.
